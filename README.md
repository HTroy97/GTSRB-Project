# GTSRB-Project
This project consisted in building a neural network capable of recognizing 43 different classes of traffic signs given the GTSRB databaset (39209 images for training and 12630 images for testing).

The requisites were:
- To use Dataloader and Dataset functions
- To print cost and F1score for each epoch and for both datasets
- To use learning rate decay
- To graph cost function and F1score for both datasets
- To use regularization
- To balance classes
